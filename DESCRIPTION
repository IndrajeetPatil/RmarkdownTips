Description: This document provides a collection of my tweets containing tips 
    and tricks related to RMarkdown), and its successor, Quarto. Although 
    originally meant for personal use, I am hoping that others might also find 
    these tips and tricks useful. This repository is not a package, and 
    the DESCRIPTION file is included to make it easier to install required 
    packages in GitHub action workflows.
