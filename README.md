# RMarkdown/Quarto Tips and Tricks

This document provides a collection of my tweets containing tips and
tricks related to [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and its
successor, [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Although the document was
originally meant for personal use, I’m hoping that others might also
find it useful.

If you’re reading this on GitHub README, you can read the tweets on this
