# RMarkdown/Quarto Tips and Tricks

This document provides a collection of my tweets containing tips and
tricks related to [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and its
successor, [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Although originally meant for
personal use, I am hoping that others might also find these tips and
tricks useful.
