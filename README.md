# RMarkdown/Quarto Tips and Tricks

This document provides a collection of my tweets containing tips and
tricks related to [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and its
successor, [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Although originally meant for
personal use, I am hoping that others might also find these tips and
tricks useful.

If you’re reading this on GitHub README, you can read the tweets on this
webpage: <https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/RmarkdownTips/>

N.B. I haven’t included any of my tweets about RMarkdown-extension
packages.
