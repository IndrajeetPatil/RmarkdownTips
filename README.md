# RMarkdown/Quarto Tips and Tricks

This document provides a collection of my tweets containing tips and
tricks related to [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and its
successor, [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Although originally meant for
personal use, I am hoping that others might also find these tips and
tricks useful.

If you’re reading this on GitHub README, you can read the tweets on this
webpage: <https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/RmarkdownTips/>

N.B. I haven’t included any of my tweets about RMarkdown-extension
packages.

# Ackowledgments

Most of these tips are from [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/)’s books and
I would highly recommend that you check them out. Except for the one
about `{knitr}`, all other books are available online **for free**.

I would especially like to thank [Christophe
Dervieux](https://github.com/cderv), who has patiently answered my
questions and queries on Twitter, GitHub, and StackOverflow. His
kindness and patience is boundless, not to mention his knowledge of the
markdown-universe.
