# RMarkdown Tips and Tricks

This document provides a collection of my tweets containing tips and
tricks related to [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). This
document is mostly to organize my own thought since it became
increasingly difficult to find the tweet I had in mind and also to
remember which tip I had shared and which I wanted to share. I will keep
updating this document as I add new tweets.

# Ackowledgments

Most of these tips are from [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/)’s books and
I would highly recommend that you check out these books. Except for the
*knitr* book, all other books are available online **for free**.

I would also like to thank [Christophe
Dervieux](https://github.com/cderv), who has patiently answered my
Rmarkdown-related questions, queries, and comments on Twitter, GitHub,
and StackOverflow. His kindness and patience is boundless, not to
mention his knowledge of the markdown-universe.

# Tweets with tips and tricks

To embed tweets in this document, I am using
[`tweetrmd`](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tweetrmd) package. These are
in no particular order. Like my brain, these are scattered all over the
place. 😅

Reusing code chunks in
<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rmarkdown?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">\#rmarkdown</a>
(using `&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;`) is a really cool feature, esp. in teaching
contexts! ♻️<br><br>You can introduce students to code components
piece-by-piece without having to repeat yourself in the underlying
document! 👩‍🏫<br><br>For more,
