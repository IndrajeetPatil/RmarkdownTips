# RMarkdown Tips and Tricks

This document provides a collection of my tweets containing tips and tricks
related to [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). This document is mostly
to organize my own thought since it became increasingly difficult to find the
tweet I had in mind and also to remember which tip I had shared and which I
wanted to share. I will keep updating this document as I add new tweets.

# Ackowledgments

Most of these tips are from [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/)'s books and I would
highly recommend that you check out these books. Except for the *knitr* book,
all other books are available online **for free**.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/rmd_books.jpeg")
```

I would also like to thank [Christophe Dervieux](https://github.com/cderv), who
has patiently answered my Rmarkdown-related questions, queries, and comments on
Twitter, GitHub, and StackOverflow. His kindness and patience is boundless, not
to mention his knowledge of the markdown-universe.

# Tweets with tips and tricks

To embed tweets in this document, I am using
[`tweetrmd`](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tweetrmd) package. These are in no
particular order. Like my brain, these are scattered all over the place. üòÖ
