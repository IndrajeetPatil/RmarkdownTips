This document provides a collection of my tweets containing tips and tricks
related to [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and its successor,
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Although the document was originally meant for 
personal use, I'm hoping that others might also find it useful.

If you're reading this on GitHub README, you can read the tweets on this webpage:
