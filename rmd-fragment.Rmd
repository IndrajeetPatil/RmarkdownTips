This document provides a collection of my tweets containing tips and tricks
related to [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and its successor,
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Although originally meant for personal use, 
I am hoping that others might also find these tips and tricks useful. 

If you're reading this on GitHub README, you can read the tweets on this webpage:

N.B. I haven't included any of my tweets about RMarkdown-extension packages.
